Installation
============

Installation is possible via pip:

'pip install richardsonpy'

(for static installation into your current Python distribution)

or

clone development version via git and install via pip (egglink):

'pip install -e <your_path_to_richardsonpy>'

Dependencies
============

richardsonpy requires the following Python packages:
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
	- xlrd

	
Example usage
=============

Example code on how to generate a stochastic user profile (profile of active occupancy; 600 seconds resolution)

.. code-block:: Python

	import numpy as np

	import richardsonpy.classes.occupancy as occ

	#  Total number of occupants within apartment
	number_occupants = 3

	#  Generate occupancy object instance
	occupancy_object = occ.Occupancy(number_occupants=number_occupants)

	#  Pointer to occupancy profile
	occupancy_profile = occupancy_object.occupancy


Example code on how to generate stochastic electric load profile (60 seconds resolution)

.. code-block:: Python

	import numpy as np

	import richardsonpy.classes.occupancy as occ
	import richardsonpy.functions.load_radiation as loadrad
	import richardsonpy.classes.electric_load as eload


	def example_stoch_el_load(do_plot=False):
		#  Total number of occupants in apartment
		nb_occ = 3

		timestep = 60  # in seconds

		#  Generate occupancy object (necessary as input for electric load gen.)
		occ_obj = occ.Occupancy(number_occupants=nb_occ)

		#  Get radiation (necessary for lighting usage calculation)
		(q_direct, q_diffuse) = loadrad.get_rad_from_try_path()

		#  Convert 3600 s timestep to given timestep
		q_direct = cr.change_resolution(q_direct, old_res=3600, new_res=timestep)
		q_diffuse = cr.change_resolution(q_diffuse, old_res=3600, new_res=timestep)

		#  Generate stochastic electric load object instance
		el_load_obj = eload.ElectricLoad(occ_profile=occ_obj.occupancy,
										 total_nb_occ=nb_occ,
										 q_direct=q_direct,
										 q_diffuse=q_diffuse,
										 timestep=timestep)

		#  Calculate el. energy in kWh by accessing loadcurve attribute
		energy_el_kwh = sum(el_load_obj.loadcurve) * timestep / (3600 * 1000)

		print('Electric energy demand in kWh: ')
		print(energy_el_kwh)
